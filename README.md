# HackTheGrind: My Ethical Hacking Journey

Welcome to my personal **CTF-Journal**! This repository serves as my learning log, where I document my journey into the world of ethical hacking, CTF (Capture the Flag) challenges, and cybersecurity. My goal is to track my progress, reflect on my learning, and build a resource that helps me improve while also providing a potential guide for others.

## About

This repository is a place to store all of my notes, solutions, scripts, and personal reflections. It includes:
- **CTF Challenge Write-ups**: Detailed solutions to challenges I’ve solved.
- **Learning Notes**: Summaries of the key concepts I’ve learned in various areas of hacking (like cryptography, web exploitation, etc.).
- **Diary**: A personal log where I track my daily progress, what I’ve learned, and any frustrations or breakthroughs.
- **Scripts & Tools**: Scripts or tools I’ve written to assist with challenges.

As I progress, I aim to document everything I encounter in an organized and accessible manner, so I can build a comprehensive resource to revisit as I continue to improve.

## Structure

This repo is organized as follows:

📂 **CTF-Journal/**  
├── 📁 **Challenges**: Solutions and explanations to various CTF challenges.  
├── 📁 **Notes**: Summaries and articles on key concepts in ethical hacking.  
├── 📁 **Diary**: Daily logs tracking my learning journey, progress, and reflections.  
├── 📁 **Scripts & Tools**: Custom scripts and tools for automating tasks or solving challenges.  
└── 📄 **README.md**: The file you're currently reading.  


## Challenges

In this section, you'll find write-ups and solutions to CTF challenges I’ve worked on. I’ll include both my thought process and the specific techniques or tools used to solve each one. These write-ups will serve as references for me and anyone else looking to learn from real-world CTF problems.

## Learning Notes

Here, I document everything I’m learning related to ethical hacking and cybersecurity. Topics include (but aren’t limited to):
- **Web Exploitation**
- **Cryptography**
- **Reverse Engineering**
- **Forensics**
- **Networking & OSINT**

The goal is to provide an overview of each topic in simple terms, along with practical examples or exercises I’ve worked through.

## Diary

This section is my personal log. It tracks my daily progress, reflections, and challenges encountered along the way. Here, I’ll include insights on what I’ve learned, what went well, and areas I need to improve. This also helps me stay motivated and focused as I push through the ups and downs of the learning process.

## Scripts & Tools

This section contains scripts and tools I’ve developed to assist with solving CTF challenges or automating tasks. If you’re looking for Python scripts, bash commands, or other small tools, you’ll find them here!

## How to Contribute

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute! Whether it’s by sharing tips, submitting CTF challenges you’ve solved, or suggesting resources, all contributions are welcome.
